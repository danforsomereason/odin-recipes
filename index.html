            <p>I made this page as a tongue-in-cheek play on recipes. But these recipes aren't for food as the Odin Project recommends. These are recipes for programming - a note to self more than anything. I started learning to code later in life. I'm 34. Sometimes I wonder whether it's too late. Whether I'm smart enough. Whether I can make it in web development. Here are some things I decided on as my first recipe:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Even if I don't get my first software engineering job until I'm 40, I could have a 25 year career in this field if I retire at the age of 65.</li>
                <li>Let's say I try to learn and improve in web dev. It takes 3 years for it to "click." I'm going to be 37 anyway, if I quit now, will I wish (at 37) that I had stuck with it?</li>
                <li>I already have a career. A Masters degree. A clinical license. I have a fall-back plan. I'm grateful that I'm not in the difficult position of starting from nothing.</li>
                <li>Sometimes I think about being able to help other people with coding. I'm not sure how just yet, but maybe I can at least help someone like me and encourage them to keep going.</li>
                <li>I think about how I spent 7 years between my Bachelor's and my Master's degrees. Was I ready for that career after one year? No. Why do I have different expectations for learning programming?</li>
            </ul>
