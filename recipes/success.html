            <ul>
                <li>Start by combining a desire to solve problems, create, and learn. Don't set aside. You'll need these.</li>
                <li>Add in persistence, resilience, curiosity, and humility.</li>
                <li>While those ingredients are simmering, start identifying projects you'd like to work on. They can be personal interests, business solutions, hobbies, or creative outlets. If you don't have any of those on-hand, you can find other projects in online resources or books.</li>
                <li>Engage in Deliberate Practice by working on things that are just outside of your comfort zone.</li>
                <li>Slice problems into quarters, then chunk, then dice, then mince. &#128521</li>
                <li>There are some very useful recipes online (google "Documentation " + *insert langauge/framework/library*)</li>
                <li>Apply thoughtfully for jobs, being sure to look closely at the job description and tailor your resume, cover letter, and approach to it.</li>
                <li>Be kind to people along the way. You never know when you may run into them in the kitchen.</li>
                <li>Don't be afraid to ask questions or to ask for help.</li>
                <li>Set a timer. No, really, look up pomodoro timer. </li>
