            <ol>
                <li>Start by wanting all the perks of being a senior developer and discard the desire to start as a beginner.</li>
                <li>Gather a list of resources and tools and set aside to rest.</li>
                <li>Copy AI-generated code and follow tutorials mindlessly.</li>
                <li>Skip the boring parts. You don't need those.</li>
                <li>Continually stir self-doubt and comparison to others.</li>
                <li>There are very explicit documentation items to learn programming languages, frameworks, and libraries, but resist the urge to read them.</li>
                <li>Apply for hundreds of jobs each week, but don't look closely at the job description or tailor your resume, cover letter, and approach to it.</li>
                
                <li>Finally, and I cannot stress this enough, do not work on building things, solving problems, or pushing yourself.</li>
