            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>There are times in life where it feels great to be cozy. Chilly fall nights by the fireplace, Christmas Eve with loved ones, or with your favorite comfort food recipe. The recipe described here seems the same, but it's different. Because this feels so good, we sometimes romanticize the feeling and follow behaviors to get that contented feeling. But over time, we confuse the feeling of comfort with the feeling of happiness.</p>
            <p>Stagnacy is defined as a state of inactivity, boredom, or depression, or a lack of growth and development. That makes it seem obvious, though sometimes it's not. Happiness is a difficult concept to grasp. It cam seem elusive. Most people confuse pleasurable feelings with happiness. Happiness is more like a state than an emotion. It's earned through accomplishment, connection with others, and reducing the number of things you <em>want</em> vs the things you have. Stagnancy feels good in the short term, but can drift us away from happiness.</p>
